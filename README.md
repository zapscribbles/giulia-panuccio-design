To run local dev server, first install Netlify CLI globally:
`npm i -g netlify-cli`

Then run
`ntl dev`

Tech stack:

-   Eleventy
-   Tailwind CSS
-   AlpineJS
-   Uses Nunjucks for layouts and partials
-   Netlify CMS

Netlify CMS allows the end user to manage project content, but also allows them to create and modify categories, exported to a file Eleventy can use as data. Bonza!
