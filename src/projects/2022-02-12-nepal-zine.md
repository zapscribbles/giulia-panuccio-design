title: Nepal Zine
description: This 20 page zine was created after a 3 week trek in Nepal. I began
  my trip in the bustling streets of Kathmandu before setting off on a trek
  through the extraordinary Himalaya mountain range via the Annapurna Circuit. I
  carried with me only a backpack full of essentials, a small camera and the
  hope that I would survive the expedition. This zine pays homage to the
  beautiful people, places and colours I encountered during my trek through
  Nepal.
