    <h2 class="mb-8">Graphic Designer</h2>
    <p>I began GP Design as a way to nurture my talents and skills. Entering the zone of creativity from ideas to execution is what drives me. This website is a collection of works designed to offer a snapshot into my varied skills and styles and contains works produced for both clients and as individual projects.</p>
    <p>My niche is logo and branding, and my passion is layout. Whether it is digital or print, I would be honoured to work with you as a design ally, assisting you in the telling of your story, whatever it may be.</p>
